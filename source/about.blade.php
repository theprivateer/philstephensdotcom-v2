    <p class="mb-6">I'm a cyclist and software developer.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">I live in Brisbane, Australia with my wife and two kids and I spend way too much time looking at bikes on the internet.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">The best way to reach me is by email at <a href="mailto:phils@hey.com">phils@hey.com</a>.</p>

    <p class="mb-6">I check email once a day in the evening, and try to respond within two days. If I'm swamped and don't manage to, feel free to ping me after that!</p>
